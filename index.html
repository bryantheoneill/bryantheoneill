			<p> I am a student at Towson University majoring in photography. Some of my main focuses are conceptual, lifestyle, and fashion portraiture as well as action sports photography. I work efficiently and creatively using strobe and studio lighting techniques while also taking every oppurtunity to capitalize on natural light.

				<p> I chose to include this website for a few reasons. Mainly because of Matt Price's excellent photography. I find that his website is a good starting off point. I like the simplicity of the pages and the way the images are displayed. I personally would change a few things, such as his logo which I find cliche and the color tends to fade into the background. I'm also not a huge fan of his font styles.

				<p> I find this site to be designed excellently. It has a very modern minimalist design while also making use of some great hover and scroll features. I like that most of the site actually seems to exists on one page with a continuous scroll but it also has tabs allowing you to jump to sections. One very small thing that makes a lot of difference in my mind is the way that when you scroll down the main title moves slightly faster than the image behind it creating a very pleasing, almost three dimensional transition. </p>
